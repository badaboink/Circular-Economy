<p>We all separate waste at home, but the situation in the construction sector is still not good enough.</p>
<p>The construction and renovation of homes generates a lot of leftover old and new building materials. The amount of waste is substantial, including items like old bricks, slabs, outdated tiles, wood, unused bags of cement, and still-functional windows and doors. Additionally, there are numerous smaller remnants of recently purchased building materials that were acquired in excess.</p>
<p>Introducing our innovative solution: envision a space where individuals can discover, exchange, and acquire building materials seamlessly, empowering you to transact in a way that suits your preferences. Welcome to a new era of convenience and choice!</p>
<p>In an ideal world, if we could connect those who have building materials and those who are looking for them, we could reduce the number of materials going to landfill. And contribute to the circular economy and zero waste philosophy.</p>
